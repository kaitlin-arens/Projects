TACSIM Notes:

In the main of TACSIM there are three different sections that I have marked off.  These sections will run individually but not all at the same time.
Just comment out sections that you are not using and the program will run.

The text.obj and out.obj contain the example code in the assignment guide.  

The .asm files contain the assembly code and the other .obj files contain the output.

The program first outputs the machine code, then it dumps the memory 16x16.
